# vk-listen-is-add-extension

A chrome extension to automatically add everything you listen to on vk.com, given two preconditions:

1. You've been listening to that thing for more than 40 seconds.
2. You ain't listening to your own playlist (TODO - oid_aid_UID! check needed).
3. You ain't listening to that song repeatedly (by maintaining chrome.storage.local database - TODO).
